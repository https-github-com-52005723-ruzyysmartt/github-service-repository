Codeship offers continuous integration and deployment for a variety of applications including Ruby, Node, PHP, Python, Java and Go.

This service hook will inform Codeship every time you push to GitHub. On every push Codeship tests the current version of your application. If all tests succeed, Codeship can also deploy your application, otherwise it informs you about the failures.
